// NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases will be discussed here, as they were made to meet problems with SQL databases

// theres four broad categories: document-based (mongodb), key-valued (redis), column-family (cassandra) and graph databases (Neo4J)
// these databases are all designed to be very scalable. Document-based provide most amount of features while maintaining good performance while key-value is simple and provides best performance for simple queries
